<li>Add the following class to the button or element you want to trigger on click <pre><code>activate</code></pre></li>
<li>Add the following class to any divs you want excluded from the animation
<pre><code>excluded</code></pre></li>

</ul>
And that's it! Enjoy!
<h3>Customization</h3>
You can change the values of the variables in the first couple of lines of skyfall.js to change the effects of the animation

The CSS animations used in Skyfall.js are not compatible with fixed-position divs. Currently, Skyfall.js works properly with absolute and relative positioned divs.
